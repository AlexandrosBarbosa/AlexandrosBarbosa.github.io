      <description>Have you ever thought of hypothetical scenarios of NBA players and how they would compare against each other stat-wise?We are going to be doing this by looking at NBA rookies and try to find out who had the best rookie season. We are going to use rookie season data from the website Data World.We will be using the NBA seasons of 1980-2016.
Since that’s a lot of data to use I’m going to narrow down the data by using our tool filter to only be looking at rookies who average at least 20 points their rookie season.</description>
