<p>Have you ever thought of hypothetical scenarios of NBA players and how they would compare against each other stat-wise?
We are going to be doing this by looking at NBA rookies and try to find out who had the best rookie season. We are going to use rookie season data from the website Data World.We will be using the NBA seasons of 1980-2016.</p>
<p>Since that’s a lot of data to use I’m going to narrow down the data by using our tool filter to only be looking at rookies who average at least 20 points their rookie season. The reason why I picked points is to really narrow down the data to get an even better picture of who had the best rookie season during our time period of 1980-2016.</p>

When we look at scoring for rookies we get a clear picture that Michael Jordan is best in terms scoring with the next closest player being David Robinson.</p>

<p>Looking at the rookies who average the most rebounds we see Shaq up there along with multiple other centers position guys right behind like Blake Griffin and David Robinson and Tim Duncan.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot() +

We are next going to look at the rookies’ assist average leaders stat. We clearly see that Allen Iverson separates himself from the rest of the pack of rookies with both LeBron James and Michael Jordan tied at 2nd.</p>

Overall, the stats here just give us a general idea of which rookie players dominated but we do know if those players were efficient or if they were just taking a bunch of shots as a result of being on a bad team so they scored a bunch of points. Stat padding is a problem because it could make other players look better than they are. We will dive in deeper and look at charts with some of the same stats but also look at player efficiency which gives us a better look at player’s value.</p>

The first chart we are going to look at is rookie season points averages but this time we will also look at the field goal percentage too. This will help us get a better insight into who was scoring while also being effective. There could be players who shoot a lot of shots and average tons of points but they may not be as effective.</p>
<p>Looking at the first chart, we see that Michael Jordan is averaging the most points by far while also having one of the top field goal percentages which shows us that Michael Jordan was very efficient. The next closest player is David Robinson who is more efficient while averaging four fewer points.</p>
<p>In our next charts, we are going to look at EFF in basketball which stands for player efficiency. Efficiency is a total performance statistic that attempts to measure a player’s performance above the number of points produced and a benchmark that allows us to compare a player’s overall individual value to other players.</p>

<p>Ron Harper has the most amount of steals but the efficiency/value of his steals is lower compared to other players like Michael Jordan and David Robinson who had fewer steals but higher player efficiency when getting steals.</p>

<p>In our last chart we are looking at another defensive stat but instead of steals, we are going to look at blocks. This time around we see that David Robinson is leading in blocks per game and is top in overall player value in this area with Shaq right behind.</p>
<p>So far we are seeing a common trend with Michael Jordan and David Robinson nearly at the top among rookies in different areas measuring player’s value and stat-wise. In conclusion, the rookie who had the best rookie season from a time span of 1980-2016 was Michael Jordan with the next best guy being David Robinson.</p>
